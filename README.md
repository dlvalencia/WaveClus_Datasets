# WaveClus_Datasets
An easy to access public repository of the waveclus datasets.

Note: We do not claim ownership of these datasets. The source can be found here: https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/engineering/research/bioengineering/neuroengineering-lab/spike-sorting


We are simply making them more readily available for research groups to use to assess the performance of their spike sorting algorithms/designs.
The files were relatively large for uploading to GitHub, so they were split into multiple rar files for easy uploading. You'll have to combine them again using WinRar.
